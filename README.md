Model Training: 
I have to .gitignore the models and the audio data due to their sizes (.wav, .pt, .pth). We will store these files in the Google Drive and you will have to insert them in your folders manually.

iOS App Development:
Xcode version 16.2
"Local STT Model Runner"

Python Interface:
You guys got this. Please make the interface look nice!

For integration with the model... it's actually pretty straightforward, please refer to the file called "model_reference_example" in your project folder for reference code.
